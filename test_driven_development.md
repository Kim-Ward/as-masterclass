# Test-Driven Development: Exercises for Cracking the Code

Suitable for implementation in a Jupyter Notebook.

* Here is a program that passes all of its tests. This will be a useful reference guide. Edit the test `ready_to_move_on = FALSE` in order to progress to the next stage.

One-letter Vigneres.

* Here is a program. Here are some abstract tests. Implement them in the actual coding language. (The program will pass them).

Ceasar Cipher.

* Here is a program that fails its tests. Debug the program so that it passes them.

Vignere Cipher.

* Here is a program. Here is a vague idea of what problem the program might have. Write some tests for it, and then debug the program so that it passes them.

Decrypt Vignere Cipher (by reversing key).

* Here is a program that is passing its tests. Add a new feature to the program and edit the tests accordingly.

Switch Vignere to Diana.

* Here is a task and some tests. Write a program so that it passes them.

Random key generator.

* Here is a task and the outline of a program. Write some tests, and then a program that passes them.

Message split into two encrypted ones via use of random key.
