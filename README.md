If the above doesn't work but you can run Jupyter Notebooks on your own machine, download the repository and run `unit_testing.ipynb`.

If the above doesn't work, this notebook can also be accessed via [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.svg)](https://notebooks.azure.com/kim-ward/projects/as-masterclass) (but you'll have to create an account).
