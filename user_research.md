# User Research (QA of Code)

## Who will be attending these masterclasses, and what do they want out of them?

What problem(s) will students learn how to solve?


What concepts and techniques will students learn?
* Identify and correct badly written code.
* Implement tests.
* Implement version control.

What technologies, packages, or functions will students use?
* Git, GitHub
* R (possibly Python as well)

What terms or jargon will you define?

What analogies will you use to explain concepts?

What heuristics will help students understand things?

What mistakes or misconceptions do you expect?

What datasets will you use?


## Learner Personas
###The Beginner:
Alex is a keen first year AS who has no prior training with programming tools, though she has used R for small amounts of statistics work before. She is attending the masterclass in order to learn the basics while in an environment where learning is guided and she can easily ask for help if she gets stuck.
* Alex may have problems during the technical setup portion of the masterclass.
* Too much unfamiliar information at once may overwhelm her.
* She may have self-esteem issues thinking she's not "good enough" to attend, and be afraid of asking "stupid questions".

###The Working User:
Brian is a second year AS who has working experience with R and with GitHub through his postings, though has not attended formal training on code QA before. He has ways of working that he has developed for himself through trial and error (i.e. his own "coding style"), which in some areas is not best practice. He is attending the masterclass to learn from the experts.
* Brian may be resistant to being told that his "coding style" is incorrect, and require convincing.
* He knows "what" tools are available, but does not yet understand "why" they are needed or "how" to use them most effectively.
* Brian is the main target of the masterclass.

###The Expert:
Charlie is a third year AS who did Computer Science at University, and has substantial experience with programming. She knows R and Python as well as several other languages, knows what "good code" and "bad code" looks like in each one, and uses Git to version-control everything she does. She is attending the masterclass primarily to network with other ASs, as she doesn't expect to learn anything new from the formal teaching part of it.
* Charlie may become bored during the "tool teaching" part of the masterclass, and wish for more advanced exercises.
* She may try to push discussions beyond the technical level of the other attendees (e.g. bringing up object-oriented programming or obscure PEP8 conventions).
* If handled correctly, she can help Alex and Brian with their learning.
* She may offer to teach a future masterclass.
